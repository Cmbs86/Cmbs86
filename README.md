### Hi there, I'm Carlosüëã


- Full Stack Web Developer with expertise in the MERN stack. I have strong skills in JavaScript, frontend frameworks like React and Tailwind CSS, and server-side programming with Node.js and MongoDB. I graduated from a comprehensive one-year full-time Full Stack Web Development program at DCI - Digital Career Insitute.

### A little about me


- üë®‚Äçüíª My background includes a technical course in environmental sciences, where I learned the importance of resourcefulness, creativity, empathy, and sustainability. Coupled with 10 years of hands-on experience as a chef, which taught me to learn by doing, I bring adaptability, critical thinking, time management, attention to detail, teamwork, and problem-solving skills.




- üé∏ Outside of development, I have a passion for travel and learning about new cultures, having lived in three different countries. Music also plays a significant role in my life. I play the bass guitar, have performed in two bands, and am currently working on a new project with friends. I frequently attend music events and see music as an essential part of who I am.
